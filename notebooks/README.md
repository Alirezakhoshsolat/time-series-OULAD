## Key Takeaways

1. **Data Preprocessing is Crucial**:
   - Proper handling of anomalies and ensuring data stationarity are foundational steps for accurate forecasting.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Different models have varying strengths. While SARIMA and ARIMAX effectively captured seasonal patterns, Prophet and CNN models excelled in handling complex trends and multiple seasonalities.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - The inclusion of lag features significantly improved the performance of ARIMAX and CNN models, highlighting the importance of feature engineering in time series forecasting.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Consistent evaluation using MAE and MAPE provided clear insights into model performance, guiding the selection of the best model.

## Methodology

We used several time series forecasting techniques:

1. **SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
2. **ARIMAX (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables)**
3. **Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)**
4. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**

## Results

The project successfully demonstrates how different time series forecasting models can be applied to predict student interactions with virtual learning environments, with the CNN model achieving the best overall performance.
